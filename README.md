DankTech is an attempt to recreate the [Dank Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dank-storage) mod, [/dank/null](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dank-null) and OpenBlocks /dev/null in the form of a plugin.

## Features
The plugin currently features:
* 9 tiers of Dank Packs. Each Tier has additional slots available inside it and each slot, in turn, has more space for items.
* Automatically moving picked up items into the relevant pack.
* Voiding for any items over the slot's limit.
* Withdrawl of items 1, by stack, by a full inventory
* Input of all matching items in inventory
* Dropping stacks into the world directly from the pack 
* Hopping items out of the Dank by placing it into a hopper
* Using blocks inside dank to build

A big shout out to the owners of [mct.tantrum.org](https://mct.enjin.com/) who let me test on their server even once it was clear I barely knew what I was doing! <3
